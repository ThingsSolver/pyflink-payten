Very
pleased
with
my
purchase.
Looks
exactly
like
the
picture
and
will
look
great
on
my
cake.
It
definitely
will
sparkle.
Very
nicely
crafted
but
too
small.
Am
going
to
have
to
add
some
flowers
or
something
to
compensate
for
the
size.
still
very
pretty
and
well
made...i
am
super
picky
so
don't
listen
to
me...*whispers*
but
it
does
look
like
the
number
5...
I
got
this
for
our
wedding
cake,
and
it
was
everything
even
more
on
in
person,
I
would
recommend
this
to
anyone.
It
was
just
what
I
want
to
put
at
the
top
of
my
wedding
cake.
I
love
it
&
it's
true
to
the
picture.
The
S
is
beautiful,
however
upon
checkout
it
informed
me
that
it
would
be
here
by
saturday
at
the
latest
(wedding
was
Sunday)
it
did
not
come
in
until
monday
AFTER
the
wedding.
Omg..
The
S
was
inexpensive
and
EXACTLY
what
we
wanted.
I
searched
everywhere
and
this
one
was
the
best
one.
It
was
a
nice
size
for
a
cake
topper
and
it
was
very
sparkley.
I
will
purchase
more
products
in
the
future
from
this
source.
Perfect!!!
Can
not
wait
to
use
on
my
Wedding
cake
in
November
good
quality
just
the
right
about
of
bling
This
was
exactly
what
we
were
looking
for
to
make
our
cake
sparkle
along
with
the
strands
of
diamonds
we
already
have
on
the
cake!
This
arrived
in
the
mail
and
it
was
packaged
so
well
so
it
doesn't
break.
It's
so
pretty
and
well
worth
my
money!
Can't
wait
to
use
it
on
my
wedding
cake
:D
No

These
are
hard
to
find
locally
and
Amazon
has
it
for
a
good
price.

I
first
tasted
this
tea
in
Costa
Rica
and
loved
it.
Best
black
tea
in
US.

Highly
recommend.
I
use
3
bags
in
a
large
16
oz
glass
mug
with
boiled
water
then
add
boiled
milk
&
sugar.
Oh
my,
it's
wonderful.
I
wish
I
could
drink
it
at
night.
if
you
like
strong
flavorful
tea
you
will
enjoy
this
Yellow
Label
I
first
tasted
this
tea
in
the
Far
East
and
really
loved
the
flavor
of
the
tea
-
I
was
disappointed
not
to
find
it
on
grocery
shelves
but
was
so
glad
that
it
is
offered
by
Amazon.
It
has
a
fresh,
clean
aroma
and
anyone
who
likes
tea
should
try
it.
Truly
the
finest
tea
bags
in
the
world.

Not

available
in
super
markets
in
the
United
States.
Try
them
once
and
you'll
get
hooked.

A+

a
retired
college
professor
who
can't
stop
giving
grades.

Dr.

Mitsakos
Tried
this
while
overseas
last
year;
don't
remember
exactly
where
since
we
were
on
a
whirlwind
tour
of
four
countries.

I
would
guess
it
was
in
a
Bangkok
or
Kuala
Lumpur
hotel.

Couldn't
find
same
brand
at
CostCo
or
the
supermarkets
here
that
we
shop
at.

Price
@
Amazon
is
a
lot
more
than
regular
Lipton
brand
but
tempted
to
order
anyway.
We
first
came
across
Lipton
Yellow
Label
Tea
on
a
trip
to
France
many
years
ago.

It
became
a
favorite
tea
when
we
travel,
and
we
found
it
from
China
to
Dubai
to
Europe.

We
live
in
a
small
town
and,
of
course,
could
not
find
it
on
local
grocery
or
tea
shop
shelves.

We
always
buy
boxes
of
it
when
we
travel,
but
were
delighted
to
see
it
for
sale
on
Amazon.

The
flavor
is
light
and
clean.
I
first
tasted
it
in
Caracas
on
a
business
trip
to
South
America.

I
immediately
tasted
the
difference
between
this
and
the
usual
Lipton''s
that
they
sell
in
the
States.

This
is
so
much
better.

No
bitterness
and
a
great
aftertaste.

I
bought
some
on
my
next
trip
back.

I
contacted
Lipton's
about
why
they
didn't
sell
it
in
the
States,
and
they
said
it
was
only
for
the
Latin
America
region.

(This
was
15
years
ago.)

They
could
not
even
get
the
Yellow
Label
in
London.

So
I
started
to
get
it
through
internet
suppliers.

When
my
favorite
went
out
of
business,
I
went
back
to
my
old
stand-by,
Amazon.

I
have
been
getting
this
from
them
since.

Everyone
that
I
have
taste
this
falls
in
love
with
it.

It
is
SO
MUCH
better
than
the
standard
Lipton
tea.

Buy
this.

If
you
love
black
tea,
you
must.
I
discovered
yellow
tea
while
on
vacation
in
Thialand.
I
drink
it
daily
now
instead
of
coffee.

In
the
summer,
it
makes
a
great
sun
tea.
Good
stuff.

The
tea
I
remember
of
50-60
years
ago...still
has
flavor!
Tasted
old
and
not
individually
bag
Addicted
to
this
tea
really
strong
taste
love
it
Best.tea.ever.
I
first
had
this
in
France,
and
it
is
not
readily
available
here
except
online.
It
is
not
marketed
in
the
US
by
Lipton,
it
must
be
bought
from
third
party
sellers,
and
it
is
NOTHING
like
the
American
market
Lipton
tea;
very
round
flavor,
much
smoother,
very
subtle
richness.
Highly
recommended!
Gift
for
college
student.
I
first
started
drinking
this
in
the
Middle
East,
and
was
impressed
with
how
much
better
it
tasted
than
the
old
Lipton
Orange
Pekoe
Tea
I
abandoned
years
ago.
I
am
glad
to
see
this
is
available
here
in
the
States.
Not
the
great
taste
everyone
was
talking
about
:(
First
had
it
Hungary
many
years
ago.
I
was
bummed
that
I
couldn't
find
it
in
the
US.
Wonderful
full
bodied
black
tea
making
a
perfect
cup
every
single
time
it's
made!
Really
good.

Really
was
not
expecting
so
much
when
ordering
two
quantities.

Enough
to
share!!
Love
this
tea,
there
are
no
oils
released
at
brewing
making
for
a
smooth
brew
that
tastes
the
way
I
like
it.

This
tea
is
not
offered
in
stores
in
the
U.S.
from
what
I've
read
Not
your
usual
Liptons.
This
tea
has
a
deep
rich
flavor,
and
a
slight
reddish
hue,
and
is
altogether
my
favorite--too
bad
it
does
not
come
in
decaf
for
later
in
the
day....
GREAT
TEA
Always
the
best!
I
was
skeptical
about
this
tea
at
first
but
after
a
few
weeks
I've
realized
the
difference
!

This
tea
is
never
bitter.

I
brew
longer
because
I
like
strong
tea
and
it
never
gets
that
over
brewed
taste.

I
would
highly
recommend
for
tea
lovers.

Especially
for
the
price!
If
you
like
strong
tea,
this
is
for
you.
It
might
even
be
a
little
too
strong
for
me.
Wow,
new
flavor
in
the
block.
This
is
the
real
tea
that
I
was
looking
for.
When
I
received
this
from
Amazon
and
I
drank
my
first
cup
I
sweat
and
felt
really
the
effect
on
my
whole
body
specially
my
head.
It
has
a
direct
effects
on
my
way
of
thinking.
I
love
it!
I
will
never
drink
any
other
tea,
but
this
one!
Terrible.
What
a
waste
of
money.
This
is
not
the
european
or
asian
brand.
Just
so
everyone
knows,
this
IS
the
orange
pekoe
variety.
I
bought
this
under
the
impression
that
it
was
just
plain
black
tea,
but
since
I
enjoy
orange
pekoe
-
I'm
not
that
angry
about
it.
I
won't
be
buying
from
this
seller
again
though.
Best
tea
available
in
the
U.S.
Same
product
and
name
as
the
tea
I've
bought
at
the
the
local
Indian
grocery
in
Edison,
NJ,
but
not
the
same
flavor.

A
bit
of
research
with
Lipton
revealed
that
it
was
blended
and
packaged
in
a
different
market.

Live
and
learn.
Love
this
tea!
Love
the
tea.
The
flavor
is
way
better
than
the
regular
Lipton
black
tea.
Definetly
worth
the
money.
I
have
searched
everywhere
until
I
browsed
Amazon
and
found
it!

This
is
the
tea
Lipton
should
be
selling
on
grocery
store
shelves.

The
stuff
I
last
purchased
is
just
awful,
and
nowhere
near
as
good
as
I
remember.
What
is
not
to
like
about
this
product?

It
has
the
rich,
full
bodied
flavor
of
the
Lipton
tea
of
long,
long
ago.

If
you
are
a
weak
tea
drinker
(i.e.
1
to
4
dunks
of
the
bag
into
your
cup
of
water),
buy
the
regular
Lipton
black
tea.

If
you
like
a
strong
rich
flavored
product,
spend
a
bit
more
and
purchase
this
Yellow
label
tea.

I
do
not
believe
you
will
be
disappointed.
Tea
made
with
Lipton
Yellow
Label
teabags
is
much
better
than
tea
made
with
regular
Lipton
teabags.
Mediocre
taste
and
not
like
the
yellow
label
from
Canada.
I
love
this
tea!

Okay,
I'm
not
a
high
falutin'
tea
snob,
but
I
first
enjoyed
this
Lipton
yellow
label
tea
when
on
a
trip
to
Singapore,
and
whether
it
was
the
room
service,
the
company,
or
the
country
-
it
left
such
a
favorable
impression
on
me,
I
search
it
out
whenever
possible.

Maybe
it's
the
same
as
the
USA's
white
label
Lipton
tea,
but
the
yellow
label
tea
appears
to
me
to
be
smoother
and
more
mellow.

I
would
highly
recommend
it
-
give
it
a
try!
Fell
in
love
with
this
tea
in
1986
when
I
went
to
Barbados
and
have
been
drinking
it
ever
since.
I
try
not
to
drink
anything
else.
So
happy
that
I
can
now
get
it
on
Amazon!
You
can't
buy
this
particular
type
of
Lipton
Tea
in
any
of
the
common
markets
in
America.

The
price
was
exceptional
and
the
tea
arrived
at
my
address
in
2
days.

Cheers!
Wonderful
tea.
It's
the
best
I
have
ever
had
!
Learned
of
this
tea
and
used
it
in
Kuwait.

Best
ice
tea
ever
The
best
tea
ever.
This
is
not
sold
in
US
market,
and
us
not
anything
like
the
Lipton
we
buy
in
the
US.
Rich,
dark
and
tasty.
Also,
they
come
wrapped
with
heavy
duty
plastic
bag
that
keeps
them
fresh
and
protects
the
box.
5
stars
all
the
way.
Discovered
this
tea
at
a
local
Med.
Rest....a
great
tea,
have
been
sharing
with
friends.

Everyone
likes
it
and
will
be
ordering
more.

Thanks
Amazon
for
carrying
this
tea,
otherwise
not
available
where
we
live.
I
discovered
this
tea
on
a
trip
to
Paris.
It
is
hands
down
the
best!
Lipton
Yellow
is
normally
great
premium
tea,
but
this
batch
tastes
the
same
or
worse
than
the
cheap
tea
in
the
grocery
store.
Well
I
bought
this
tea
after
being
in
Malaysia
for
several
months,
mostly
to
try
making
teh
tarik
without
using
loose
tea
as
we
did
several
times.
I
failed
with
regular
Lipton
black
tea,
thought
the
difference
must
be
because
of
Yellow
label.
That
turned
out
to
be
wrong,
the
problem
is
the
condensed
milk
which
is
clearly
different
in
Malaysia
than
what
I've
been
able
to
get
in
the
U.S.

I
would
say
the
taste
is
marginally
different
than
regular
Lipton
black
tea,
if
you
had
me
do
a
blind
taste
test
I'm
not
convinced
I
would
be
able
to
know
which
I
was
drinking
with
a
reliable
success
rate.

I
ordered
4
boxes
and
the
packaging
was
sealed
well,
but
it
has
this
unmistakable
dust-like
taste
that
is
ruining
the
tea.

Edit:
I've
gone
through
2
boxes
and
only
the
first
had
the
dusty
taste.
The
others
are
fine,
and
pretty
much
taste
the
same
as
regular
Lipton
black
tea
We
really
like
this
tea.

It
is
definitely
different
from
the
regular
yellow
box
of
100
that
I
get
in
the
stores.

You
can
tell
the
difference
when
you
drop
them
into
hot
water.

They
sink
much
faster
than
the
regular
ones.

In
the
end,
I
think
they
have
a
somewhat
stronger
flavor
that
is
good.

I
plan
to
keep
buying
these.
If
you
liked
the
tea
you
drank
in
England,
try
this.
Hard
to
find
in
the
U.S.A.

Exactly
as
described,
good
quality.
Normally
this
tea
rates
5
stars,
it
has
a
wonderful
rich
flavor,
nothing
like
the
regular
Lipton
tea
found
in
grocery
stores
in
this
country.

However,
this
batch,
with
a
production
date
of
12/2013,
has
seams
that
open
up
during
brewing
and
the
tiny
tea
leaves
spill
into
the
cup
necessitating
for
the
tea
to
have
to
be
strained.

I
hope
that
this
is
an
anomaly
and
that
future
batches
will
live
up
to
its
usually
wonderful
quality.
Lipton
Yellow
Label
tea
is
very
concentrated
--
you
don't
have
to
use
a
large
quantity
to
get
excellent
flavor.
This
makes
for
a
good
money
value,
as
you
extract
maximum
taste
from
small
proportions
of
leaves.
This
version
of
Lipton
tea
reminds
me
of
how
Lipton's
used
to
taste
--
a
good
,
traditional,

Pekoe
flavor.
In
recent
years,
I
feel
Lipton
has
declined
in
quality
in
their
bagged
tea,
but
this
loose
Lipton's
is
much
closer
to
the

I
make
the
best
brewed
iced
tea
with
this
yellow
label
Lipton
tea.
I
make
it
by
the
gallon
using
the
same
amount
as
regular
loose
teas.
I
only
add
1/4
cup
of
sugar
per
gallon.
This
tea
has
quickly
replaced
soda
and
tastes
even
better.
After
opening,
I
transfer
the
entire
contents
into
a
glass
container
(not
plastic)
with
a
metal
screwed
lid
to
keep
the
air
out.
We
love
this
tea
and
hope
Amazon
keeps
carrying
it.
This
is
my
third
purchase
of
Lipton
Yellow
Label
Loose
Tea.
Service
on
my
purchase
was
excellent,
it
arrived
expeditiously
and
well
packaged.
This
tea
is
special
to
me,
it
doesn't
take
a
lot
of
it
to
brew
up
into
a
nice,dark
(
I
don't
like
weak
tea!)and
flavorful,
fully
enjoyable
cup!
